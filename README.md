## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
We are looking for a landscape designer to help us get the most space and use out of our 490 square meter garden.  We have made an initial start at landscaping, but realized that without an overall plan, it quickly becomes difficult to prioritize and make decisions.

We hope that by commissioning a front and back garden design, new ideas will be suggested and specific design and material choices will be made.

A [pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/dijk0381/trampoline/) has been created which illustrates the ideas we have.

## Back Garden <a name="Back"></a>
